    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Ganapathiraju Sri Harshita, a third-year Computer Science Engineering student with a strong passion for software development, problem-solving, and learning new technologies. Over the past few semesters, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript, and gained hands-on experience with tools such as Git, React, and Node.js. I'm particularly interested in full-stack development, competitive programming, and exploring areas like machine learning and cloud computing. I enjoy building projects that challenge my skills and push me to grow as a developer. Currently, Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world environments through internships or collaborative tech projects.</p>
